description: 'For his critically-acclaimed To Pimp a Butterfly LP, Kendrick Lamar premieres a short film featuring the tracks “u” and “For Sale?” Starting off in a dark room with a bottle of brown, a drunk K-Dot travels to the dark corridors of his mind, as “u” is a song that exposes his insecurities, selfishness and failures. The TDE artist then dives into his standout interlude, “For Sale?”, a track that examines the evils and hypocrisies of the music industry.  Source:HYPETRAK'
