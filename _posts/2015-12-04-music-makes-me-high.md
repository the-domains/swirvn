From Church Jams, to R&B, Punk, Rock, Dubstep, Classical, Country. I worked in the music Business for many years Managing Independent Artist, running street teams, and Consulting with New Artist.  Music has helped me get through the hard times, has been there to mark beautiful moments in my life, make me laugh, partied with, danced to, sing along with, to partying with Friends & Family.
